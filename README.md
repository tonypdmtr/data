# data
An assortment (to be) of SQLite3 databases in dumped form.

Re-create database by running the command:

sql database.db < database.sql

where
 * SQL is your actual SQLite3 path (see below),
 * DATABASE.DB is whatever file you want to name your database, and
 * DATABASE.SQL is the file you downloaded from here.

You can get pre-compiled SQLite3 shell for
[Windows](http://www.aspisys.com/sql.exe) or
[Linux i386](http://www.aspisys.com/sql)
